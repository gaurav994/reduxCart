# reduxCart

React with Redux used to implement a product listing page with functionality to add/remove products in cart and manage cart. 
Note: Cart and home page used common Product listing page for code reusability . 


Master Branch : Code till 18 July Screen Sharing .


Feature/CompleteCart : Coded after Screen Sharing .
-- Product list page - add products to you cart 
-- cart page - manage your cart 
NOTE : as current user is  hardcoded and dummy service is used , discrepancy in cart data - shows count as five but products not present in product list so no data shown in cart 
to use cart functionality add items in cart from product listing page on app load. 



STEPS TO RUN THE APPLICATION 

1. Install dependencies - npm install 
2. Start the application - npm run dev ( to start in dev mode )
